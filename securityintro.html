            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold section-title">What is Cybersecurity? üõ°Ô∏è</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Offensive security, a key component, focuses on actively finding and exploiting vulnerabilities to help organizations build stronger defenses. It's about thinking like an attacker to better protect the target.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        A network penetration tester simulates real-world attacks to find weaknesses in an organization's internal and external network infrastructure. They use tools like Nmap to scan for open ports and Metasploit to test for known vulnerabilities. Their day-to-day role involves planning test scenarios, executing attacks to find a point of entry, escalating privileges, and writing detailed reports for the client to fix the issues.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Cloud penetration testers focus on the unique security challenges of major cloud providers: AWS, Google Cloud (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. They look for misconfigurations in cloud storage (like S3 buckets), insecure IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles, and vulnerabilities in serverless functions. Their role is critical as more companies migrate their data and services to the cloud.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        This is one of the most popular entry points into the field. Web app testers find and exploit vulnerabilities in websites and web services, such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and broken authentication. They often use specialized tools like Burp Suite and Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) to automate and manually test for vulnerabilities.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Active Directory (AD) is a directory service used by most large companies to manage user and computer identities. An AD penetration tester's job is to find weaknesses that would allow an attacker to gain full control of the network. They commonly use tools like BloodHound and Mimikatz to map out the network and exploit vulnerabilities like Kerberoasting or pass-the-hash attacks to gain domain administrator privileges.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        This is a highly advanced and technical field. Binary exploitation involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in compiled software (binaries). Exploit development is the process of creating a working program (an exploit) that takes advantage of a specific vulnerability, often for remote code execution. This requires a deep understanding of assembly language, memory management (stack, heap), and reverse engineering.

                        Malware analysts reverse-engineer malicious software to understand its functionality, origin, and how it spreads. They analyze viruses, ransomware, trojans, and other threats to create detection and prevention strategies. Their work is crucial in developing antivirus software and threat intelligence.

                        Cryptography is the science of secure communication. While it is a defensive field, it's also crucial for offensive security professionals to understand how to test for flaws in cryptographic implementations, such as weak algorithms or incorrect key management that could lead to data breaches.

                        An attacker sends a fraudulent email disguised as a trusted entity (e.g., a bank or a government agency). The email asks the recipient to click a link and enter their credentials. Once the user enters their information, the attacker steals it.

                        This is a common web application attack. An attacker inputs malicious SQL code into a web form. If the application is not properly secured, this code can be executed by the database, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data from the database.

This is a critical step for a post-exploitation phase, as it helps determine if they need to perform privilege escalation to gain higher-level access to the system.
